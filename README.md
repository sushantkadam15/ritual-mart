I had the opportunity to lead the branding, design, and development of an MVP landing page for Ritual Mart, a startup aiming to make traditional rituals more accessible.

The goal was to create a simplified platform to validate the idea of providing all needed ritual items and instructions in one convenient place. This MVP would allow testing demand before building out an entire e-commerce site.

## Crafting the Brand Identity
As the sole contributor, I shaped Ritual Mart's brand identity for this early stage. The logo, colors, and typography aligned with the mission of hassle-free ritual participation.

## Designing a Landing Page
Using Tailwind CSS and user-centered principles, I designed an intuitive landing page MVP to introduce the concept and gauge interest.

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- CSV

## Developing the Landing Page
With the tech stack above, I built a user-friendly landing page. PHP collected user emails into a CSV file to continue validating the idea.

## Project Outcome
Since the startup was discontinued, the founders kindly allowed me to publish the codebase on the GitHub repo.

## Key Takeaways
This comprehensive project enabled the quickly validating a concept through strategic branding, design, and development. I welcome discussions about creating this Ritual Mart MVP using Tailwind CSS and PHP.
