# Ritual Mart

Ritual Mart is a web application aimed at providing a convenient platform for all your pooja (ritual) needs. Whether you're looking for essential puja items, religious artifacts, or specialized products for specific ceremonies, Ritual Mart has got you covered.

## About

I had the opportunity to work with Ritual Mart, a startup based in India dedicated to providing a seamless shopping experience for customers seeking pooja essentials. As part of the project, I was responsible for planning everything from the color palette to the typography, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

The goal of this project was to gauge public interest and validate the market demand for an online platform catering to pooja requirements. To assess user engagement and gather insights, we ran Google Ads campaigns, driving traffic to the Ritual Mart website and analyzing user interest.
